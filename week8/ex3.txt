After the executing the ex3.sh file I will see on the top of the screen that memory each iteration wiil decrease on 10 mb. (after removing the free())
In oposite way using free() the memory will almost not change
I think this actions is obvious, because I am using the malloc() wich allocate the memory on 10mb (in our case) and with free() ecah iteration the memory will be clean. 
But without it the progrgram will require 10mb more and more
