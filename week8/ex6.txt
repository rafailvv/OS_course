Virtual address - 16 bit. The number of virtual addresses - 2^16

Pages - 8 KB. I should also convert into the bytes
In 1 KB = 2^10 B = 1024 B => 8*2^10 = 2^13 B = 8192 B

Fro computing the number of entries are need for a single-level linear page table we should divide the virtual addressess to the pages
2^16 / 2^13 = 8 - number of pages that we need to have in page table  

Answer: 8
