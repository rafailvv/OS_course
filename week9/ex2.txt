1. To INCREASE the hit-to-miss ratio, the input data must contain pages with the same number. 
Then the number of hits will be equal to m, and the number of misses will be zero. 
Their ratio will go to the infinity
2. To DECREASE the hit-to-miss reatio, the all pages should have the unique numbers.
Then the hit and miss will be equal to 0, therefore ratio also equal to zero.
